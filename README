A port of CodeShop (BV) 's Mp4Split which is originally a Unix/Linux tool. The documentation can be found here:

The original source was downloaded from:

http://h264.code-shop.com/download/mp4split-2.2.0.tar.gz

The port is a quick and dirty port. I just added the missing headers, or replaced Unix headers with some el-cheapo replacements I found.
Code should compile without warnings and errors.

Original licensing applies.

I've added a binary version of Mp4Split for Windows for the lazy people.
